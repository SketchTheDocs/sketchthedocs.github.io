# [About #SketchTheDocs](https://sketchthedocs.github.io)

#SketchTheDocs is about bringing visual storytelling and literacy skills to technical writing, technology documentation and related communication modalities for developers and their audiences. 

Humans communicate and learn in multiple ways:
 - Reading/Writing 
 - Kinesthetic (by doing)
 - Auditory (by listening)
 - Visual (by seeing & interpreting)

In general, most of us will use more than one of these approaches, combining them in context for maximum value. Articles [like this one](http://visualteachingalliance.com/) suggest that nearly 65% of users are visual learners who absorb information from visual cues, vocabulary and imagery.

With _visual storytelling_ I want to focus on a journey that takes us from basic skills to advanced concepts for communicating complex ideas. This includes: 
 - Visual Storytelling Toolkit (basic skills)
 - Sketchnoting (rapid information capture)
 - Anthropomorphism (connecting with characters)
 - Visual Metaphors (transfer learning by familiarity)
 - Animation (elevate storytelling with motion)
 - Comics/Zines (elevate storytelling with narratives & structure)
